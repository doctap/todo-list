# React App with TypeScript and MobX

I represent to your attention [ToDo-List](https://doctap.github.io/todo-list/).

## Application functionality 

### `1`  Add a task
### `2`  Delete a task
### `3`  Check a task
### `4`  Open a task
### `5`  Filtrate tasks

You can also check the responsiveness of the app ;)
